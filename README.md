# NucDeck
The Open Source DIY Handheld Gaming PC!

 --- WARNING - PCB's and software incomplete. Begin at your own risk! ---

Refer to "Assembly Instructions.PDF" for assembly details.

There are two different versions of the housing, Standard and NoRGB. The NoRGB version has had
the RGB joystick surrounds removed to simplify printing. If you choose the NoRGB version you can leave all of the 
associated components off the PCB's to save on cost.

There are two different versions of the buttons, membrane and clicky. The Membrane buttons are shorter and are
designed to be used with silicone membranes. I've included files for molds to make the membranes. If you have a resin printer
I encourage you to give this a try as it improves the feel of the buttons dramatically. FDM printers will struggle to produce the accuracy required to make these parts. The clicky version is slightly taller and can be used without the membranes.
